## Security Considerations

### Profile Updates

1. **Email Changes**
   - User must verify new email
   - Notification sent to old email
   - Account marked as unverified until confirmed

2. **Phone Number Changes**
   - Check uniqueness
   - Update all related records
   - Send confirmation notification

3. **Password Verification**
   - Required for sensitive operations
   - Not required for basic profile updates

### Device Management

1. **Device Tracking**
   - Fingerprint-based identification
   - IP address logging
   - Last activity tracking

2. **Device Deactivation**
   - Only device owner can deactivate
   - Stops FCM notifications
   - Can be reactivated on next login

### Account Deletion

1. **Verification**
   - Password required (for non-OAuth accounts)
   - Confirmation string required
   - Cannot be undone

2. **Data Removal**
   - Cascade delete related records
   - Remove from cloud storage
   - Send confirmation email

## Error Handling

Common error scenarios:

```typescript
// Phone number already in use
{
  "statusCode": 409,
  "message": "Phone number is already in use",
  "error": "Conflict"
}

// Email already in use
{
  "statusCode": 409,
  "message": "Email is already in use",
  "error": "Conflict"
}

// Device not found
{
  "statusCode": 404,
  "message": "Device not found",
  "error": "Not Found"
}

// Invalid file upload
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "No file uploaded",
  "error": "Bad Request"
}

// Incorrect password
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "Password is incorrect",
  "error": "Bad Request"
}

// Invalid confirmation string
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "Please confirm account deletion by sending \"DELETE_MY_ACCOUNT\"",
  "error": "Bad Request"
}
```

## Best Practices
